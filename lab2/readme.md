# Iris Dataset Classification using Linear Regression
This project aims to classify the Iris dataset using a linear regression algorithm implemented from scratch using NumPy. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning, consisting of measurements of different Iris flower species.

## Dataset Description
The Iris dataset contains measurements of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of three different Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). The goal is to classify the flowers based on these features.

## Linear Regression
Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for regression tasks. In this project, we adapt linear regression for classification by mapping the output to discrete class labels using a threshold.

## Implementation Details
The implementation of the Iris dataset classification using linear regression from scratch involves the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Load the Iris dataset and preprocess it by performing necessary data cleanings and transformation steps, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Linear Regression Model: Implement the linear regression model using NumPy. 
Training: Train the linear regression model using the training set. This involves feeding the training data to the model as a matrix.

3. calculating the weights  (w=(Z^T * Z)^-1 * Z^T * b) 
4. Testing and Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the testing set. Calculate relevant metrics such as accuracy.
