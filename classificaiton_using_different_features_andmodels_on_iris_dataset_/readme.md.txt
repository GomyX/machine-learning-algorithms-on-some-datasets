# Classification Using Different Features and Models on the Iris Dataset
This project aims to explore the classification task on the Iris dataset by using different features or combinations of features and testing the accuracy. Additionally, it involves comparing the performance of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with another classification model of choice using cross-validation. Finally, the project utilizes GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the final model's performance.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset is a popular and well-known dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Each sample is labeled with one of three classes: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

## Classification Using Different Features
In this project, we explore the impact of different features or combinations of features on the classification accuracy. By selecting different subsets of features or combining them in various ways, we can assess how these choices affect the performance of the classification model.

To use different features or combinations of features, follow these steps:

1. Load the Iris dataset into the program.

2. Select the desired features or combinations of features from the dataset. For example, you can choose to use only sepal length and petal width as features, or combine sepal length and petal length.

3. Split the dataset into a training set and a test set.

4. Train a classification model using the selected features on the training set.

5. Evaluate the accuracy of the model by predicting the class labels for the test set and evaluating them using score matrics.

6. Repeat the above steps for different feature selections or combinations and observe the changes in classification accuracy.

## Cross-Validation and Model Comparison
To compare the performance of KNN with another classification model(SVC), we utilize cross-validation. Cross-validation is a technique for assessing the model's performance by splitting the dataset into multiple subsets, training and evaluating the model on different combinations of these subsets. This helps in obtaining a more robust estimate of the model's accuracy.

Follow these steps to compare KNN with another classification model:

1. Implement KNN and the chosen classification model (e.g., SVC) in the program.

2. Perform cross-validation using both models on the Iris dataset. For each model, train and evaluate it on the whole data.

3. Compare the average accuracy evaluation metrics obtained from cross-validation for both models.


## Conclusion
This project explores classification on the Iris dataset using different features or combinations of features, compares KNN with another classification model using cross-validation. By leveraging these techniques, you can gain insights into the impact of feature selection, assess the performance of different models, and improve the classification accuracy.
