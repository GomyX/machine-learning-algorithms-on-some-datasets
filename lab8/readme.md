# Implementing K-Means on MNIST Dataset
This project focuses on implementing the K-Means clustering algorithm on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to explore unsupervised learning techniques and apply K-Means clustering to group similar images together. The readme provides an overview of the project and outlines the steps involved in implementing K-Means on the MNIST dataset.

# Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of a large collection of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, along with their corresponding labels. The dataset can be accessed from various sources, such as the scikit-learn library or online repositories.

# Project Description
1. Data Preprocessing: Perform any necessary preprocessing steps on the MNIST dataset. This may include scaling the pixel values, reshaping the images, or normalizing the data to improve clustering performance.

2. Implementing K-Means: Implement the K-Means algorithm ```from sklearn.cluster import MiniBatchKMeans```. K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that aims to partition data into K clusters based on their similarity.

3. Model Training: Apply the K-Means algorithm to the MNIST dataset and train the model on the image data. The algorithm will iteratively assign each image to its closest centroid and update the centroids based on the mean of the assigned images.

4. Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the performance of the K-Means algorithm using accuracey metrics .

By implementing K-Means clustering on the MNIST dataset, this project aims to group similar images together and gain a better understanding of the inherent patterns and structures within the dataset. The findings and observations can have applications in various fields, such as image recognition, digit classification, or anomaly detection.
