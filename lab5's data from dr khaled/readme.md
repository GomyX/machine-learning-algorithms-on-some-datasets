# Classification Using SVM with Hyperparameter Tuning
This project focuses on classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on given datasets, and comparing the results of classification before and after hyperparameter tuning. The goal is to optimize the performance of the SVM classifier by tuning its hyperparameters and assessing the impact on classification accuracy.

## Dataset
The datasets used for this project are provided externally. Make sure you have downloaded and prepared the datasets before proceeding. You can place the datasets in the appropriate directory or location.

## SVM Classification
SVM is a powerful machine learning algorithm commonly used for classification tasks. It works by finding an optimal hyperplane that separates data points belonging to different classes. SVM can handle both linear and non-linear classification problems through the use of various kernel functions.

The classification process involves the following steps:

1. Load the dataset into the program.

2. Split the dataset into a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the SVM classifier, while the test set will be used to evaluate its performance.

3. Train the SVM classifier using the training set.

4. Perform classification on the test set using the trained SVM classifier.

5. Evaluate the classification results by calculating metrics such as accuracy.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is essential for optimizing the performance of machine learning models. In this project, we aim to improve the SVM classifier's accuracy by tuning its hyperparameters.

To perform hyperparameter tuning, the following steps are taken:

1. Identify the relevant hyperparameters that affect the SVM classifier's performance. These may include the kernel type, regularization parameter (C), and kernel-specific parameters (e.g., gamma for the RBF kernel).
2. Define a range of values for each hyperparameter to be explored during the tuning process.
3. Apply a hyperparameter optimization technique such as grid search or random search to systematically search through the defined parameter space.
4. Train and evaluate the SVM classifier using different combinations of hyperparameters.
5. Compare the classification results before and after hyperparameter tuning, considering metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of classification using SVM and the impact of hyperparameter tuning on classification accuracy. By optimizing the SVM classifier's hyperparameters, we can potentially achieve better results in terms of classification performance.
